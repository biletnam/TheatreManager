# TheatreManager

As part of my Systems Analysis, Design and Process module me and 6 others had the task of building a Theatre Management Suite, which was capable of managing plays, performance times, bookings, users, etc, all according to a specification given to us.

We spent around 60 hours on the project, and I personally focused on creating a Manager which can read/write to the database, and created functions that the interface designers could use.
